					The Victorian Era was the period in which Queen Victoria ruled over the United Kingdom. It lasted from Victoria‚Äôs enthronement in June 1837 until her death in January of 1901. The Victorian Era occurred during the Colonization period, in which the British Empire ruled over a vast amount of area throughout the globe. It was a prosperous Era for The United Kingdom. The Industrial Revolution, new industries and steam engines were invented and the British Empire turned into a prosperous Great Power

				<p class="sub_heading">Politics</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					Great Britain was a monarchy during the Victorian period. Which means that a King or Queen led the country, in this case Queen Victoria. A Prime minister was elected by the people. Even though not as strong as the Royal Family, the prime minister was extremely important to the state and his main role was to make political choices for the country. The Victorian Era gave more people the right of vote, even though only men were allowed to.
				</p>
				
				<p class="sub_heading">The House of Commons</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					The House Of Commons is the lower house of the British parliament. It consists of 650 members which are voted by the people. It has more power and is more important than the prime minister and is responsible for the bills and the inspection of the prime minister and The House Of Lords. New parliaments are elected every five years.
				</p>
				
				<p class="sub_heading">The House of Lords</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					The House Of Lords is the upper house of the British parliament. All the members are referred to as ‚Äò‚ÄôLords‚Äô‚Äô and there is an adjustable number of seats. During the Victorian era, you had to work your way up to earn a seat at The House Of Lords. Its responsible for discussing different topics that affect the country and for checking the Prime minister and The House Of Commons. The House of Lords was established
				</p>
				
				<p class="sub_heading">Monarchism</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					Monarchism during the Victorian Era made a change from Absolute to Constitutional Monarchy. The Queens power was reduced significantly and the Prime minister and Parliaments were granted the leadership of different topics affecting the British community. But Victoria‚Äôs decrease in power wasn‚Äôt absolute. The Queen still had the power of influencing both the Parliament and the Prime minister, taking part in discussions and meetings and giving advice. She still had the power to change different rules in the court system.

				<p class="sub_heading">Society</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					The role of women in the Victorian era depended little on class. A woman‚Äôs role was to take care of the house and be obedient to their husbands. This was very restrictive and oppressive for women but it did allow them a more carefree lifestyle in that the man could decide most things for them. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Women‚Äôs role differed only slightly between classes
				</p>
				
				<div class="dot_fields">
					<ul>
						<li>Upper-class women had servants to do all their household work. They were educated so that they could better command their servants.</li>
						<li>Middle-class women only needed to take care of the house, the children and their husband.</li>
						<li>Working-class women often had to work to help support the family and had it tougher to maintain the household.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Women were not supposed to study. An educated woman was sometimes called a ‚Äúblue-stocking‚Äù and was seen as unattractive. Women were taught something called accomplishments in school that included things like dancing, drawing and singing. In addition to this, they were also raised to be obedient to their husbands and other men because that was considered their duty.
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Women were very dependent on their husbands since they were rarely employed. They also did not have the right to vote. This was justified by the fact that women had the power to raise the next generation and power over the household. Most women married at around 20 years old to men that were about 5 years older. Being unmarried was frowned upon and since they had less rights, fathers could marry them off to a man against their will.
				</p>
				
				<p class="sub_heading">Societal life</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					The rift between the classes was large during the Victorian era and moving up a class was very rare. The classes were as follows
				</p>
				
				<div class="dot_fields">
					<ul>
						<li>Upper-class, rich and rarely worked.</li>
						<li>Middle-class, the men had to work all day but afforded a house and food every day.</li>
						<li>Working-class, underpaid workers with barely enough to eat. Often forcing their children to work despite being paid even less.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					The people lucky enough to be born into the upper class lived a life of pleasure and relaxation. They rarely needed to work and had servants to do everything for them. The upper class was a small minority.
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Those of the middle-class had a relatively easy life. The men worked all day to support the family while the women took care of the house and the children studied. They had some extra money so they could afford minor luxuries.
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Working-class citizens were underpaid workers that often hardly afforded food and housing. The work they performed was often dangerous and difficult. Despite their hard work, they were paid so little that they often had to force their children to work.
				</p>

				<p class="sub_heading">Economy</p>
				
				
				<p class="text_field">
					The Victorian Era (1837-1901) was a critical change in Britain‚Äôs social culture and economy. Suddenly, people started moving into cities, working in factories and the middle class grew out from the poor. However, how could a country achieve such a change just under 60 years? We will dig into it, getting a solid understanding of Britain‚Äôs biggest economic blast!
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Key factors of the economic growth
				</p>
				
				<div class="dot_fields">
					<ul>
						<li>Industrialisation</li>
						<li>Steam Engines</li>
						<li>Colonies</li>
						<li>Middle Class</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p class="sub_heading">Industrialisation</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					The industrialism was at the peak of the time. England had the fastest urbanization rate through the whole world. Cities grew fast and the colonies were bringing in the finest goods to the ports of Liverpool. It was comfortable for the lower class people who did not had to pay large taxes on land anymore, and could rely on a fix wage from their employers (well mostly). However, receiving a monthly salary secured them a much safer, less stressed future. It inspired farmers to join big cities, such as Birmingham. The government soon realised that the growth of the industries are giving more tax than taxing the lands.
				</p>				
				<p class="sub_heading">Steam Engines</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					In the end of the 18th century, Richard Trevithick invented the steam engine. Railways were built throughout Britain; transportation went much faster than before. Factories relied on the steam engines as well, since bigger industries used steam engines to run their factory lines. Coalmines were working much faster than before, and the coil was essential for the industries around the country.
				</p>				
				<p class="sub_heading">Colonies</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					England was spreading throughout the world and had the biggest empire of the time. With India on the top, Britain received more taxes and rare raw materials that not many of the current colonies could provide. The other colonies had it good as well. They provided the British industries with essential materials such as:
				</p>		
				<div class="dot_fields">
					<ul>
						<li>Salt</li>
						<li>Cotton</li>
						<li>Tobacco</li>
						<li>Spices</li>
						<li>Tea</li>
					</ul>
				</div>				
				<p class="text_field">
					Salt was the most important of them all, which was very rare and expensive at the time. Colonies also had to pay taxes, which continued to add a big plus into the British budget.
				</p>				
				<p class="sub_heading">Middle Class</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					The Middle Class was not as usual, as it is today. In third world societies there are the wealthy and the extreme poor that inhabits the country. The Victorian Era ended the third world state of Britain for good. As people moved into cities, they did not had to bother with weather and luck to get by on the fields. People received a monthly wage, and with the secure money, people could afford expensive things and more taxing for the government. More people buying things and paying tax == $$ for the British government. The middle class played a very important role in the society. People with money had the opportunity to educate their kids, the future of the country. Middle class citizens also had the knowledge to decide wisely between what political party they could benefit from. The corruption in Britain‚Äôs parliament started dropping, and Politian‚Äôs were forced to reuse the tax money into the future of the hard-working man. These were the first step into free education in Britain.

				<p class="sub_heading"><b>Article</b></p>
				<p class="text_field">
					Charles Dickens was born in 1812 and was a novelist and journalist of the Victorian era. He wrote popular books such as Oliver twist, A Christmas Carol, David Copperfield etc. and was remember as the most influential writer of the time. His first novel ‚Äò‚ÄôOliver Twist‚Äô‚Äô was a great success, people loved it and the novel was about an orphans life in the streets. 
				</p>

				<p class="text_field">
					He came from a poor family and his was the second of eight children.  Both of his parents did their best in order to become rich and support the family but despite their best efforts, the family remained poor. They moved into the countryside where Dickens and his siblings were allowed to go outside and roam around which affected him and his books.
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Later in 1843, Charles Dickens released his book called A Christmas Carol. The book was about the timeless protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge, a curmudgeonly old miser, who, with the help of a spirit. Finds the Christmas ghost. Dickens wrote the book in just 6 weeks. In addition, published it before Christmas and sold more than 6.000 copies. He died because of a stroke at the age of 58 (June 9, 1870). 
				</p>

				<p class="sub_heading">Characteristics</p>
				<p class="text_field">
					The Victorian era offers many types of stories but the most popular ones shared some defining Characteristics, setting them apart from the Romantic age. The novels often revolved around hard work, love and perseverance. This is because the printing press allowed even the working class to afford books. A good portion of the readers lived through lives so reading about others working hard and getting rewarded for it would have a great effect on them.
				</p>

				<p class="text_field">
					Most poems on the other hand, focused around the England of the past with knights in shining armor and great castles. This was both to impress the people of the large empire and to remind the English people of their glorious history. A new form of literature developed in this period, the scientific texts. While these texts are not considered as literature, they still show how the people became more and more interested in understanding and explaining the natural world instead of listening to the older religious stories.   
				</p>
				<p class="sub_heading">Book Analysis </p>
				<p class="text_field">
					Oliver Twist is one of Charles Dicken‚Äôs most famous novels. The novel was written in 1839 and focuses on the life of an orphan child and how society refuses to help and aid them. After fleeing to London, he meets a group of kids and enters their pickpocketing gang. After an unsuccessful pickpocketing, Oliver ended up in the home of the crime‚Äôs victim. His life becomes unstable and his journey through trouble-town continues. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					The novel is focusing on how poverty and harsh living conditions can lead into the wrong path and criminality. However, it also shows us how the industrial revolution affected the society and foremost the poor. Individualism became a thing and people believed that it was better if everyone looked after their own self. A great example of that philosophy comes from a kid named Fagin, who operated in the pickpocketing gang. He said that ‚Äò‚ÄôA regard for number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.‚Äù Which means that the group will be able to operate smoother if everyone looks after themselves. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Children Vulnerability is also another theme brought up by Dickens. Oliver tries his best in order to survive , but he only manages to do so by having rich and powerful adults helping him. Another example of powerless happens during a court scene where Oliver loses the ability to speak. The judge tries to help him out by giving him a name arbitrarily but even then the adults sitting in the courtroom who ignore and fail to understand some clear and direct statements.    
				</p>
				
				<p class="sub_heading">Impact On Society</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Charles Dickens did not start out as a writer at first. He always enjoyed entertaining people, ever since he was a kid. He had a dream of changing the world, and he knew that the easiest way for people to understand the problems is through entertainment. He believed that showing the darker face of society through entertainment would stick into people‚Äôs head easier, making a bigger impact on their feelings.
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					His tactics were the following; instead of forcing the reader to think what it is like for the poor man, he put the reader into the poor man‚Äôs situation. Dickens wrote in his book ‚ÄúImagine someone like you or someone you like was in somewhere like that‚Äù. With this tactic, Dickens made the reader think of themselves, or a family member which made a bigger impact after finishing the book.
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					His second tactic was the smartest, and the most used psychology in modern pop culture as well. What is that small thing that both the poorest and the richest have in common? Well, it is the small things in live that makes a men‚Äôs life happy. Being with the family, a nice food, a dinner with friends, a Christmas celebration or just a hug from someone you love. When the reader got into these situations in the book, no matter what economic situation they had, they felt themselves a part of the story. And when the bad situations started to happen they could relate themselves and their family members as going through the story.
				</p>
				
				<p class="text_field">
					Charles Dickens with his writing talent and life experience changed the world, and created a way to  reach all ages and backgrounds so that everyone can sympathise with other peoples situation. This technique is still used today both in media and in other fields.
