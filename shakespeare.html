		<h2> Shakespeare and the Renaissance </h2>
	<br>
	<h3> Characteristics of the Renaissance </h3>        
<p> Renaissance in French means “rebirth”, therefore the renaissance can looked on as the rebirth of humanism. We also made many new discoveries during the renaissance in music, fine arts, philosophy and many other fields.
<br><br>
<h3> Fine arts </h3>
Sculptors started using older techniques like contrapposto (an Italian term, which is a way to visualize a human standing with all his weight on one foot). Paintings and sculptures also started to focus more on regular people instead of religious themes.
<br><br>
<h3> Literature </h3>
During the Renaissance, many people started studying Latin and Greek, so that they could translate old books and turn it into new books. The invention of the book press also allowed them to make more literature. Popular categories of literature were Poetry, Religion and politics. One of the most important authors during the Renaissance was William Shakespeare. The texts he wrote during the Renaissance was not attached to religion. He wrote a lot about drama who were not religious, the main focus was not about god anymore. Many of the texts during the Renaissance were about religion, since the people of Britain just went through a reformation they wrote a lot about religion. More specifically the texts were questioning the orthodoxy in the relationship to the church.
<br><br>
<h3> Science </h3>
The most important advancement made during the Renaissance were made in Italy by Galileo Galilei. He worked on the telescope allowing us to get a better understanding of the universe.
<br><br>
<h3> Religion </h3>
Protestantism started during the Renaissance, which has a lot to do with authors studying Latin to be able to translate books such as the bible into English so everyone could read the bible. Not just the priests. </p>
<br><br><br>


<h2> William Shakespeare’s Life </h2>
<p> Shakespeare was born in Stratford-Upon-Avon on 26 April 1564. He married at the age 18 to Anne Hathaway and had three children. Shakespeare had a career in London where he worked as an actor, writer and part owner of the playing company where he worked. The majority of Shakespeare’s work was produced in between 1589 and 1613. His best works were the ones he produced in the beginning of his career. These were mainly comedies and histories but later in his career, he started writing tragedies, however the tragedies were not considered to be as good as the comedy ones, judging by the fame of the books. There is barely any information left about Shakespeare’s life in terms of appearance, sexuality or religious beliefs.
<br><br>

<h3> His works </h3>
<p> Shakespeare is an English poet, playwright and actor. He created some if not the most important English poetry in history. He is very important to the English culture and his works has been translated to all living language and even 400 years after his death he has prevailed and is largely known in English culture and especially among playwrights today. Many of his most famous works has been a lot, and has inspired movies, video games and books.  Some of his most famous works are Romeo & Juliet and Hamlet. Romeo and Juliet is his most famous and its cultural impact is huge even to this day. It is a tragedy about two star-crossed lovers, who end up dead because of their feuding families coming between their loves. It was released early in his career and quickly become one if his most performed. Today it’s a classic has been all forms and entertainment.
His second most famous work is Hamlet; it is about a prince in Denmark. In addition, the struggle he faces in the kingdom. Dealing with the country, love, enemies.  It’s also a really famous piece he has made and is performed regularly around the world. </p>
<br><br><br>



<h2> Authors during the Renaissance </h2>
 
There were many authors in England during the renaissance, such as; Christopher Marlowe, John Milton, John Donne.
<br><br>
<b>Christopher Marlowe</b>, born in Canterbury, England 1564. His professions were poetry and playwriting. He influenced Shakespeare with his playwritings. Marlowe died in Deptford, England 1593; reason of death is still a mystery.
<br><br>
<b>John Milton</b>, born in Bread street London 1608. He was a great poet from England, he was known for his huge ambitions and his goal to become the biggest author in the world.  He came really close to his goal; his masterpiece “His paradise lost” is one of the most read book in the world. “His paradise lost” was a religious text, which referred to hell and Satan.
<br><br>
<b>John Donne</b>, born in London 22 January 1572, another great poet/lawyer/ priest from England under the renaissance period. He is mostly known for religious and romantic poems. The Flea is his most known work and it is an erotic story. The poem evokes the aphorism carpe diem, which is Latin for "seize the day". Donne encourages the woman to focus on the present day and time versus saving herself for the afterlife. Donne is able to hint at the erotic without explicitly referring to sex, using images such as the flea that "pampered swells" with the blood of the woman.
<br><br>
<b>Ben Johnson</b> is the last author I am going to write about, that is because his character was like Shakespeare, he wrote and he played. He was born in Westminster, London. Same year as John Donne, being author/poet in this time was common, as you see from the birth years. He has a famous work named Volpone, Volpone is a comedic play about being greedy and lust. It is Johnsons most played game and it is seen as the finest play under the Jacobean Era.
<br><br><br>


<h2> Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet </h2>
 Romeo and Juliet is a tragically ending love story about two lovers from different families. The conflict between these families eventually leads to Romeo’s death, which in turn reunites the families. This play is arguably Shakespeare's best, or at least his most popular. Along with his play Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet is still very popular to this today, over four centuries after its release. Shakespeare took inspiration and essentially copied some of the plot from Arthur Brook, a contemporary and an English poet, who in turn rewrote and translated an Italian tale.
<br><br>
What made William’s version of the story so special and popular was a combination of things. He expanded upon the existing story, filling out side characters and adding his own style into it. I think it being in English was of big help, although the story was already available in English format. I think the primary reason for its popularity was because it was written by William Shakespeare, an already established author. Having a lot of good plays under your belt makes it much more likely that people will check out your work. That is not to undermine his play of course, but already being famous has its advantages.
 <br><br><br>
<h2> William Shakespeare’s impact </h2>

Was Shakespeare work beneficial for today’s English? Well, if you ever used words like  “suspicious”, “addiction”, “bedroom”,” hint”, “swagger” or “accused”. Then maybe his work was not for nothing. Shakespeare introduced over 1,700 word and 135 phrases. Most of the words are still used today, and the English language we know today would not be same without Shakespeare’s impact. 
He have written many of the most famous theater plays ever made. Othello, Henry v and Romeo and Juliet is just a few of them. His masterpieces are still played today all over the world, and still affects the world with the emotional and meaningful plays.
But, how did he do it? Shakespeare made all his plays with something important or that should be change in the society, something that is important for people. And most of the plays meninges are still meaningful and relatable with today’s problems. The way he told the audience his story’s with phrases and words made his plays more than just something different.
